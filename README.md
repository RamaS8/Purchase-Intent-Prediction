# Purchase-Intent-Prediction
Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether an e-commerce browsing session will result in a purchase (conversion) by analyzing user clickstream data. By accurately identifying purchase intent from session behavior, marketers can target high-intent customers with real-time personalized campaigns, improving conversion rates and marketing ROI

. We leverage an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) platform (DataRobot) alongside custom feature engineering to build and evaluate predictive models. The result is a data-driven framework that not only achieves strong predictive performance but also provides actionable insights (e.g. via lift charts and conversion probability thresholds) to inform business strategy.
Problem Statement
Online retail businesses face the challenge of distinguishing browsing sessions that will lead to a purchase from those that won't. Formally, the task is a binary classification: given a sequence of user actions (clickstream) in a session, predict whether the session ends in a purchase. This is often termed the clickstream purchase intent prediction challenge

. The problem is highly imbalanced (typically only a small percentage of sessions result in a sale) and complex due to varied user behaviors. Solving it is valuable – with global e-commerce sales exceeding $5.7 trillion in 2022 and making up over 20% of retail sales

, even modest improvements in conversion targeting can yield significant revenue gains. Accurately predicting purchase intent enables targeted marketing, focusing efforts (like discounts or personalized messages) on sessions that are likely to convert, thereby increasing conversions and avoiding wasted advertising spend

Dataset Description (Anonymized)
The model is trained on an anonymized e-commerce clickstream dataset collected from an online retail website. Each record corresponds to a user session and includes a sequence of page interaction events with associated metadata. Features were derived to characterize each session without using any personally identifiable information. For example, the data includes metrics such as:
Session activity counts: number of pages viewed in different categories (product pages, info pages, etc.) and actions like add-to-cart.
Duration and timing: total time spent on the site, time on each page category, time of day and whether the session occurred on a weekend.
Traffic and user info: traffic source or campaign tags, device type, browser, region, and whether the visitor is new or returning (all in anonymized form).
Engagement metrics: indicators like bounce rate (whether the session exited after a single page) and exit rate per page, similar to Google Analytics metrics

.
Sequential patterns: the order of actions or pages (e.g. viewing a product followed by adding to cart), captured via features like the count of category transitions or presence of certain event sequences.
Each session is labeled with a binary target: 1 if a purchase (transaction) occurred, or 0 if not (no conversion). The dataset contains thousands of sessions spanning multiple months of activity. All user identifiers were removed or encoded to ensure privacy. (Note: Due to privacy and NDA constraints, the actual dataset cannot be released. The project README uses aggregated and anonymized information for illustration.)
Feature Engineering Summary
We performed extensive feature engineering to transform raw clickstream event sequences into informative predictors for the model. Key steps and feature types include:
Static session features: Pre-aggregated metrics per session such as total number of page views, number of product pages viewed, number of search queries made, adds to cart, and whether any checkout page was reached. These give an overall snapshot of session intensity and product interest.
Temporal features: Features capturing time-related aspects, for example: session duration (total time on site), average time per page, time since the last user session (if user is returning), and indicators for time of day or day of week. These help incorporate temporal patterns (e.g., sessions during certain hours or longer sessions might have higher purchase likelihood).
Sequential features: We encoded aspects of the order of events in the session. This included flags for specific sequences (such as viewing a product then adding to cart), counts of back-and-forth navigation actions, and the position of key events (e.g., did the user view a product in the first few clicks or only late in the session?). Such features capture the behavioral patterns within the clickstream.
AutoML-driven feature generation: In addition to manual features, we leveraged DataRobot's automated feature engineering capabilities. The AutoML platform automatically created and evaluated numerous derived features (combinations, ratios, text mining on URLs, etc.) across the dataset
datarobot.com
. This process can uncover subtle patterns (for instance, interactions between features or lagged behavioral metrics) that might be missed in manual feature creation. We reviewed the top AutoML-generated features for consistency and interpretability before inclusion.
All features were scaled or encoded as needed (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical variables like browser or region). We took care to avoid data leakage by ensuring that features were computed using only information available up to a given session’s end (since we aim to predict conversion before it happens). The final feature set combined dozens of features across the categories above, providing a rich representation of each user session.
Modeling Approach
Our modeling approach combined AutoML experimentation with traditional model tuning to identify the best predictor of purchase intent:
AutoML (DataRobot) Experimentation: We uploaded the prepared dataset to DataRobot, which automatically tried a wide range of algorithms and pipelines. DataRobot trained over 100 candidate models (including logistic regression, decision-tree ensembles, randomized forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, neural networks, etc.) with various preprocessing steps
datarobot.com
. The platform ranked models by performance on a validation set (using ROC AUC as the primary metric), and it also provided insights like feature impact and model blueprints. This gave a strong baseline and indicated that the top performers were mostly tree-based ensemble models.
Model Comparison and Manual Tuning: Based on the AutoML results, we focused on advanced gradient boosting machines for further experimentation. In particular, we trained models using LightGBM and XGBoost (with Python libraries) as they were among the best in AutoML and are well-known for winning machine learning competitions due to their speed and accuracy
datascientest.com
. We performed hyperparameter tuning for these models (using techniques like cross-validation and Bayesian optimization) to maximize performance. We also included a simpler logistic regression model as a baseline for interpretability comparison.
Evaluation Procedure: We split the data into training and test sets (preserving chronological order to mimic real-world deployment, and ensuring no session from the future leaks into training). The training process (for both AutoML and manual models) used cross-validation on the training set to guard against overfitting. The final chosen model was evaluated on the hold-out test set to report unbiased performance metrics. We focused on metrics suitable for imbalanced classification: Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) for overall ranking performance, F1-score for a balance of precision/recall, and lift/gain charts for business interpretation of results. We also examined precision-recall curves and confusion matrix at selected thresholds to understand the trade-offs.
Model Selection: The best model turned out to be an ensemble of tree-based models (from the AutoML) that was very similar in performance to a tuned LightGBM model we trained manually. Both achieved high AUC scores, but the ensemble edged out slightly and was chosen for deployment due to its robust performance. Additionally, we considered model interpretability: DataRobot's platform provided feature importance rankings and partial dependence plots, which helped ensure the model's behavior aligned with domain intuition (for example, seeing that features related to product page views and time on site were top predictors of conversion, which matches expectations

).
Results Summary
The predictive model achieved strong results in distinguishing purchasing sessions from non-purchasing ones:
ROC AUC: Approximately 0.88 on the test set. This indicates the model is highly capable of ranking sessions by purchase likelihood (an AUC of 0.5 would be random guessing, 0.88 is considered excellent). In practical terms, the model can correctly discriminate a randomly chosen buyer vs non-buyer pair about 88% of the time.
F1-Score: Around 0.55 at the selected probability threshold (optimized for the best F1 on the validation set). This reflects a balanced precision and recall, given the imbalanced data. By adjusting the threshold, we can trade off precision vs. recall depending on business needs – for instance, a higher threshold yields higher precision (fewer false alerts to marketing) at the cost of lower recall (some buyers won't be flagged), and vice versa.
Precision and Recall: At the chosen operating point, the model’s precision was ~0.50 and recall ~0.60 (meaning about half of the sessions the model flagged as “likely purchase” did result in purchases, and it caught ~60% of all actual purchase sessions). These figures can be tuned by shifting the score threshold. Notably, even with moderate precision, the model is far more useful than a naive classifier: only ~2% of sessions result in a purchase, so a trivial model predicting “No Purchase” for every session would be 98% accurate yet have zero recall of buyers

.
Lift Chart (Conversion Lift): The model’s effectiveness is well illustrated by a lift chart. For example, if we rank all sessions by predicted purchase probability, the top decile (10%) of sessions contains roughly 50% of the actual purchasers in the dataset. In other words, by focusing marketing efforts on the 10% highest-scoring sessions, one would capture about half of all buyers – achieving about a 5× lift over random targeting
kdnuggets.com
. This high lift demonstrates that the model successfully identifies the truly high-intent sessions. The cumulative gains chart also shows a steep upward curve early, confirming that the model concentrates positive outcomes towards the top-ranked predictions (which is ideal for targeted marketing).
Model Interpretation: The features with the most influence on the model’s predictions were intuitive. Session engagement metrics dominated: for instance, the number of product page views, total session duration, and whether the user added an item to cart were among the top predictors (these factors all strongly increase conversion likelihood). This aligns with common sense and literature, where deeper engagement and efficient product browsing are linked to higher purchase intent

. Other important features included the visitor type (returning visitors were more likely to buy than first-timers) and time-related features (sessions closer to peak shopping hours or during weekdays had different conversion probabilities). We also verified there were no spurious drivers – DataRobot’s explainability tools (e.g., Feature Impact charts) helped confirm that model decisions were based on sensible patterns in the data

.
Overall, the results show that our model can reliably predict purchase intent and provide a substantial improvement over baseline targeting. High AUC and lift indicate the model is effective at prioritizing likely buyers, which is crucial for downstream marketing actions.
Business Impact and Recommendations
Targeted Marketing Strategy: Using this model, the marketing team can implement a targeted engagement strategy to increase conversions and optimize spend. Instead of treating all website visitors alike, we can tailor interventions based on each session’s predicted conversion probability:
High-Intent Sessions (e.g. conversion probability > 80%): These users show strong purchase intent. They might be on the verge of buying, so heavy incentives are not necessary (they may purchase regardless). The strategy could be to assist rather than discount – for example, provide a streamlined checkout experience or suggest complementary products (upsell) to increase basket size. Ensuring nothing disrupts these users (e.g., no intrusive pop-ups) can help seal the deal.
Mid-Intent Sessions (e.g. probability ~50–80%): Users in this range are interested but not guaranteed to convert. This segment is ideal for targeted promotions or nudges. For instance, offering a limited-time discount or free shipping can push them over the threshold to purchase. Alternatively, a chatbot or customer service prompt offering help with product information could address any hesitations. By focusing special offers on this group, the business spends incentives where they are likely to make a difference
kdnuggets.com
.
Low-Intent Sessions (e.g. probability < 50%): These are casual browsers or unlikely to buy in the current session. It may not be cost-effective to offer immediate promotions to this entire group. Instead, the strategy can be to capture their info for remarketing (if possible) and let them continue browsing unhindered. Post-session, they can be retargeted via email or ads to nurture interest based on what they viewed. Over time, as more data is collected, some may be identified as potential future buyers (e.g., if they return and their score improves).
By setting a conversion probability threshold (or multiple tiers of thresholds), the business can automate real-time marketing actions. For example, the model might flag a session with a score of 0.85, triggering an on-site personalized offer, whereas a session with score 0.20 gets no special intervention (saving marketing resources for more promising leads). Studies have shown that such personalized, clickstream-driven targeting can boost click-through and conversion rates significantly compared to one-size-fits-all campaigns

. Estimated ROI: Based on the lift analysis, if the company targets the top 10-20% of sessions with tailored incentives, it could capture a large fraction of potential buyers while minimizing spend on unlikely conversions. This means higher overall conversion with lower marketing cost per conversion. In essence, marketing efforts become more efficient – resources are concentrated where they yield the highest return. This approach can increase revenue (through higher conversions and larger average order values via upselling) and also reduce wasted ad spend on low-probability customers

Implementation Plan
To realize this solution in a production environment, we outline an implementation plan with both data science and engineering steps:
Model Deployment: Package the final trained model for deployment. Using DataRobot's deployment functionality, we can deploy the model as a real-time prediction service (via API) in their MLOps platform. Alternatively, we can export the model (e.g., the LightGBM model) and deploy it on our own infrastructure as a REST API (for instance, using Flask or FastAPI in a cloud environment). The deployment should handle receiving session data and returning a conversion probability quickly (within milliseconds, for real-time use).
Data Pipeline Integration: Integrate the model into the website or marketing stack. The website can send each active session’s feature data to the model API to score purchase probability in real-time (perhaps after a minimum number of clicks or time on site to gather sufficient data). Based on the score and pre-defined business rules, the system triggers the appropriate action. For example, if the score exceeds the “offer threshold,” an on-screen promo code or chat prompt is shown to the user instantly. If using marketing automation software, the predictions can be fed into those systems as well – e.g., sending the session/user ID and score to a tool like HubSpot or Salesforce to queue up personalized emails or ads

.
Monitoring and Feedback: Once deployed, monitor model performance continuously. This includes tracking the model’s prediction accuracy over time (comparing predicted vs actual conversions as new data comes in) and the uptake of marketing actions. We would set up dashboards to watch key metrics like precision/recall on new data, conversion lift in targeted groups vs control groups, and overall conversion rate improvement. It's also important to ensure the model’s decisions make business sense; using explainability reports (feature importance, SHAP values, etc.) in production can help validate that the model remains aligned with expected behavior.
A/B Testing and Iteration: Before a full rollout of automated targeting, conduct an A/B test or pilot. For example, run the model-driven targeting for a subset of traffic, while another subset gets the standard marketing treatment, and compare conversion outcomes. This will quantify the real impact (e.g., “the targeted group saw a +X% lift in conversion rate”). Use the results to refine the strategy or thresholds if needed. Once confident, scale up to all traffic.
Periodic Retraining: User behavior and market trends evolve, so the model should be retrained periodically. We plan to retrain the model with fresh data (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to capture new patterns (seasonality, new product lines, etc.) or whenever monitoring indicates performance degradation. With an AutoML pipeline, retraining can be automated to some extent. The dataset and feature engineering pipeline will be updated with new sessions, and the model will be re-selected/tuned. DataRobot’s automation can expedite this process. Each new model version will go through validation to ensure it meets or exceeds the previous version’s performance before deployment.
Documentation and Training: Provide clear documentation for the system (for marketing and engineering teams). This README, technical docs in the repository, and DataRobot model documentation (blueprints, feature descriptions) form the knowledge base. Additionally, train the marketing team on how to interpret the model outputs (e.g., what a 0.7 conversion probability means) and how to adjust campaign rules if needed. We will also outline fallback plans (for example, if the model service is down, what default experience should users get – likely the generic experience without personalized offers).
By following this plan, the predictive model transitions from a prototype to a deployed solution that continuously adds value. The integration with business processes ensures that insights from data science are effectively used to drive decisions (in this case, deciding who gets targeted marketing in real time). Crucially, we maintain a feedback loop: as the model influences user behavior (through incentives), those outcomes are measured and fed back into model improvement, creating a cycle of data-driven optimization.
How to Run this Project
(Note: The following instructions assume access to the project repository and relevant tools. This project leveraged proprietary tools (DataRobot) for some steps; where not accessible, alternative open-source approaches are provided.)
Clone the Repository: Download or clone this GitHub repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
Install Dependencies: Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt. This will include libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc. (If using DataRobot, you would also need the datarobot Python client or access to the web platform).
Acquire Dataset: Due to privacy, the actual dataset is not included. However, you can use a similar public dataset for demonstration (for example, the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset
archive.ics.uci.edu
 or any e-commerce clickstream dataset). Place the CSV data file in the data/ folder. Update the data loading path in the notebooks/config to point to your data file.
Run Exploratory Analysis: Open the Jupyter notebook notebooks/1_EDA_and_Feature_Engineering.ipynb. This notebook explores the dataset and performs feature engineering. Run all cells to generate the features and visualize initial insights (distributions, correlations with the target, etc.). The engineered feature set will be saved as a new file (e.g., data/processed/session_features.csv) for modeling.
Run Modeling Notebook: Open notebooks/2_Model_Training_and_Evaluation.ipynb. This notebook trains the machine learning models. By default, it will train a LightGBM model on the feature set (and you can optionally train an XGBoost or logistic regression for comparison). If you have DataRobot access, you may skip the manual training here and instead follow the steps to use the DataRobot platform (instructions provided in a markdown cell in the notebook). Otherwise, proceed with the open-source models. The notebook will output performance metrics (ROC curve, AUC, F1, confusion matrix, lift chart data). It will also save the trained model (e.g., as a pickle file in the models/ directory).
Review Results: After training, the notebook will display the evaluation plots and metrics. You can find the lift chart and ROC curve in the results/ folder (they are also shown inline in the notebook). The lift chart can be reviewed to choose a probability cutoff for targeting. We have included a script to calculate and print out the conversion rates by decile of predicted score, to help in threshold selection.
Business Analysis: For a deeper understanding, read through the docs/Business_Analysis_and_Recommendations.md (if provided) or refer to the Business Impact section above. This explains how to interpret the model output in a marketing context. We also provide example code (in the notebook) demonstrating how to apply the model to new session data for scoring.
Deployment (Optional): If you wish to simulate deployment, you can run the app/predict.py script with a sample input (this requires you to have saved a model). This script loads the trained model and prints a predicted probability for a given session JSON. This mimics the behavior of a deployed API. (For a real deployment, you would wrap this logic in a web service.)
Customization: Feel free to experiment with the notebooks – try creating new features or using different algorithms (e.g., Random Forest or a simple Neural Network) and compare results. The modular structure allows swapping out components easily. You can also adjust the threshold in the evaluation step to see how precision/recall trade-offs change, which is useful for different marketing scenarios.
By following these steps, you can reproduce the core analysis and understand how the model was built and evaluated. The repository is organized to facilitate learning and extension.
